      <h2>I help organisations create engaging digital experiences and robust
        software products.</h2>

        consulting, however my experience extends to building websites and apps
        using a great variety of languages, frameworks, CMSs and APIs.</p>

        digital world, such as the BBC, Channel 4, MTV, Virgin and Comic

      <p>Communication is the most important tool in software development. Less
        planning and processes, more working software and feedback. Humanising
        the development process ensures the right product is built for the
        right users, the user experience is frictionless, and the code is
        straightforward.</p>
      <p>I help clients gain a competitive advantage by delivering a quality
        product that is reliable, reusable and easy to maintain. I try to work
        smarter, not harder, using modern tools and best practices to deliver
        thorough work in good time.</p>
